## Installation
Take note that the <a href="https://github.com/soonann/travel-app-backend">main</a> branch is a local version of the project, where the database resides locally in your docker as a container.

Furthermore, the <a href="https://github.com/soonann/travel-app-backend">main</a> branch does not have the AWS Cognito API implemented, this is to facilitate faster testing of the endpoints locally.

To see a version with the AWS Cognito API implemented, you can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/soonann/travel-app-backend/tree/production">production</a> branch. The <a href="https://github.com/soonann/travel-app-backend/tree/production">production</a> version has CI/CD configured to deploy on AWS ECS to the endpoint <a href="https://travel.potatovault.com">https://travel.potatovault.com</a>
